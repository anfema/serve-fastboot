# serve-fastboot

[FastBoot](https://ember-fastboot.com) server module that can be used with any of our [Ember](https://emberjs.com) projects.

## Configuration

This project uses [rc](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc) to handle configuration. See `src/config.js` for defaults. The `distPath` is the only required configuration, although in most cases `port` should be adjusted as well.
